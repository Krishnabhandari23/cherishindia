# Admin Registration Feature Implementation

## ✅ What Was Added

### Frontend Changes (Login.tsx)

1. **Enhanced Registration Form**:
   - Added role selection field with User/Admin options
   - Visual feedback showing what each account type provides
   - Dynamic helper text based on selected role
   - Shield icon for the account type field

2. **Form State Updates**:
   - Added `role: 'user'` to registerForm state (defaults to user)
   - Updated form submission to include role in API call

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - User Account: "Browse products, make purchases" 
   - Admin Account: "Manage products, orders, and users"
   - Warning icon for admin accounts
   - Standard user icon for regular accounts

### Backend Changes

1. **API Service (api.ts)**:
   - Updated register method to accept optional `role` parameter
   - Maintains backward compatibility

2. **Redux Store (authSlice.ts)**:
   - Updated registerUser async thunk to accept optional role
   - Passes role to API service

3. **Server Route (auth.js)**:
   - Updated register endpoint to extract role from request body
   - Validates role against allowed values: ['user', 'admin']
   - Sets role in user creation data

4. **Database Model**:
   - User model already supported role field with enum validation
   - Default role is 'user' if not specified

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Role Validation**:
   - Backend validates role against enum: ['user', 'admin']
   - Invalid roles are ignored, defaults to 'user'
   - Frontend provides clear selection options

2. **Admin Access Control**:
   - Admin check updated from `user?.isAdmin` to `user?.role === 'admin'`
   - Consistent role-based access throughout the application

## 📝 Usage Instructions

## 🎯 Testing

### Test Scenarios:
1. **User Registration**: Register with role "user" → Should create standard user
2. **Admin Registration**: Register with role "admin" → Should create admin user
3. **Default Behavior**: Register without role → Should default to "user"
4. **Role Validation**: Send invalid role → Should default to "user"
5. **Admin Access**: Login as admin → Should see admin panel
6. **User Access**: Login as user → Should not see admin panel
